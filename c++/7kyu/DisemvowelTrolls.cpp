/*
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

# include <string>
# include <iostream>

std::string disemvowel(const std::string& str) {
  std::string retStr = "";
  int len = str.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (str[i] != 'a' && str[i] != 'e' && str[i] != 'i' && str[i] != 'o' && str[i] != 'u' && 
        str[i] != 'A' && str[i] != 'E' && str[i] != 'I' && str[i] != 'O' && str[i] != 'U') {
      retStr += str[i];
    } else {
      continue;
    }
  }
  return retStr;
}
